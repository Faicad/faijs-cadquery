/**
 * @faicad/cq-compat/sketch (merged 2026-10-02, ex standalone package) — CadQuery Sketch.py-compatible 2D sketch container
 * for faijs.
 *
 * CadQuery grammar surface (unprefixed names; the cq-compat main package
 * exposes the same functions with a `sketch` prefix):
 *   import { sketch, rect, circle, polygon, faces, wires, extrude } from
 *     '@faicad/cq-compat/sketch (merged 2026-10-02, ex standalone package)'
 *
 *   let s = sketch()
 *   s = rect(s, 2, 2)
 *   s = rect(s, 1, 1, { mode: 's' })
 *   let solid = extrude(s, 2)
 *
 * Phase 2 (max-cadquery plan) non-planegcs surface: geometry declarations +
 * modes a/s/i/c/r + selectors + the sketch→extrude outlet. The constraint
 * segment (`constrain`/`solve`) is intentionally out of scope pending the
 * planegcs LGPL-2.0-or-later legal verdict.
